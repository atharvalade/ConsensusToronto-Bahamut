**StakePay** is an AI-assisted invoice and agreement tool built on Bahamut that transforms plain-language work agreements into smart contract-powered, trustless task flows — secured by mutual staking.



## 🧠 Why StakePay?

In Web3 freelance, DAO, and B2B workflows, informal coordination still dominates — chats, spreadsheets, and soft promises. StakePay replaces this with lightweight, AI-generated smart contracts and a programmable trust mechanism.



## 🔧 Features

- **AI-generated invoices** from natural language prompts  
- **Mutual staking** as a trust and commitment layer  
- **Escrow-based payment flow** with smart contract logic  
- **StakePay Score** — credit points earned by successful task completion  
- **Status tracking**, milestone timing, and completion consensus



## 🌀 User Flow

1. **Prompt AI Assistant** – Describe the task in plain language  
2. **Invoice Generated** – Includes stake amount, dates, dispute window  
3. **Supplier Stakes** – Then shares the invoice link  
4. **Buyer Reviews & Stakes** – Invoice becomes active  
5. **Work Begins** – Status: In Progress  
6. **Mutual Completion** – Both parties confirm  
7. **Reputation Updated** – Credit points awarded
